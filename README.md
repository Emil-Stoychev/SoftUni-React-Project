# Online Shop
This is my final exam for softuni react project defence
For this project i used **[ReactJS](https://bg.reactjs.org/)** for client and **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** for backend.

The idea of the application is an Online Store where after successful registration or login, you can browse, buy, like, comment and create your products that you want to sell!
