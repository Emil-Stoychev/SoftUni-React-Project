This is my final exam for softuni react project defence
For this project i used **React** for client and **Express** for backend.

## Backend API Documentation
This is the API documentation where you will be able to find information on all the endpoints for the "*Online Shop*" project.
For data base i used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) 

## Used dependencies:
- Express

- bcrypt
- jsonwebtoken
- cors
- cookie-parser

### Instalation and start server in server folder:

### To install all dependencies
